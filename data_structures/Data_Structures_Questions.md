Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depthFirstForEach` method?
    O(n)
2. What is the space complexity of your `depthFirstForEach` function?
    O(n)
3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadthFirstForEach` method?
    O(n)
4. What is the space complexity of your `breadthFirstForEach` method? 
    O(n)
5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?
    O(nlogn)
6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?

    The space complexity of the `heapsort` function is O(n) since a new output array was created with the sorted data. If the function altered the input array, the space complexity of the function would be O(1). The reason for this is that altering the input array does not require additional storage to store data. Instead the data is re-arranged in this case.
